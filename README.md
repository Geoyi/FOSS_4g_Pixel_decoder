The Pixel Decoder repo is over here: https://github.com/Geoyi/pixel-decoder, in case you want to see what behind it. 

The files in this repo: 

- `Label-Maker_Pixel-Decoder.ipynb` is the walkthrough IPython notebook on how to run Pixel Decoder using nvidia-docker; 
- `Dockerfile` to create a docker image to run Pixel Decoder;
- `tz_road_prediction.geojson` is the vectorized road prediction geojson files from a model I ran to showcase what Pixel Decoder can do.
